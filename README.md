# Language Switcher - Component template for Magnolia CMS #

A simple control to allow users to switch the language on the website. Displays all languages configured for the current site.

## Features ##
The control can render as an unordered list or as a select box.
How it renders can be configured by developers via parameters in the definition, and by authors in the dialog.
