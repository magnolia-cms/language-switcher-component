# Language Switcher - Component template for Magnolia CMS #

A simple control to allow users to switch the language on the website. Displays all languages configured for the current site.

## Features ##
The control can render as an unordered list or as a select box.
How it renders can be configured by developers via parameters in the definition, and by authors in the dialog.

## Contribute to the Magnolia component ecosystem
It's easy to create components for Magnolia and share them on github and npm. I invite you to do so and join the community. Let's stop wasting time by developing the same thing again and again, rather let's help each other out by sharing our work and create a rich library of components.

Just add magnolia-light-module and magnolia-component as keywords to the package.json to make them easy to find and use.

## Notes
* This is not officially supported Magnolia CMS code. This is a community contribution.
